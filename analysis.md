# Introduction

Describe the algorithms of your choice

# Consideration
There are various types of scheduling algorithms which are First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, Round Robin Scheduling, and Shortest Remaining Time. For this project we decided to use non-preemptive algorithms which are  First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling.Using FCFS, SJF and priority scheduling, we applied the processes with the same data to evaluate the average time taken and average turn around time. The data are arrival time, burst time and priority.We consider the SJF algorithm will give the shortest average for turn around time.  

# Analysis 

## FCFS

Give an analysis of your algo and compare it with the other two

## SJF
For the shortest job first algorithm, this algorithm has the shortest execution time for the next execution. In non-preemptive SJF scheduling,the process holds it until it reaches a waiting state or terminates once the CPU cycle is allocated to the process. This algorithm gives the shortest average waiting time for a process better than FCFS and priority scheduling algorithms. Thus, the processes can be executed faster.
